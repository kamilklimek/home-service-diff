# Home Service application
This application is currently at the beggining of the development. It is based on the Home Assistant application for the Raspberry.  The idea is to create a home control hub, whic would run on a Raspberry Pi with touch screen attached. For now, all that is being implemented is a backend Java Spring application.

Api KEY in resources/static/api_keys.txt is deprecated so it won't work. If you want to use weather, go to weatherbit.io and create an account.
